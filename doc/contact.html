<!--TOC paragraph Mailing Lists:-->

<H5> Mailing Lists:</H5>It is strongly recommended that all Unison users subscribe to one of the
first two: 
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-announce"><B>unison-announce</B></A>
is a moderated list where new Unison releases are announced. It is very
low volume, averaging about one message per month. <BR>
<BR>
To subscribe, you can either visit 
 <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-announce">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-announce</A> (you will be
 asked to create a Yahoo groups account if you do not already have one),
 or else send an email to
 <A HREF="mailto:unison-announce-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com"><B>unison-announce-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com</B></A> (which will
 simply add you to the list, whether you have a Yahoo account or not).<BR>
<BR>
 
<LI><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-users"><B>unison-users</B></A> is a
 somewhat-higher-volume list for users of unison. It is used for
 discussions of many sorts --- proposals and designs for new features,
 installation and configuration questions, usage tips, etc. It is also
 moderated, but just to filter spam.<BR>
<BR>
To subscribe, you can either visit 
 <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-users">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-users</A>
 or else send an email to
 <A HREF="mailto:unison-users-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com"><B>unison-users-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com</B></A>.<BR>
<BR>
Release announcements are made on both of these lists, so there is
no need to subscribe to both.<BR>
<BR>

<LI><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-hackers"><B>unison-hackers</B></A> is
for informal discussion among Unison developers.. Anyone who considers
themselves a Unison expert and wishes to lend a hand with maintaining and
improving Unison is welcome to join. This list is moderated to filter
spam.<BR>
<BR>
To subscribe, you can either visit 
 <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-hackers">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unison-hackers</A>
 or else send an email to
 <A HREF="mailto:unison-hackers-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com"><B>unison-hackers-subscribe@groups.yahoo.com</B></A>.
</UL>
Archives of all the lists are available (and publically visible) via the
above links. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC paragraph Reporting bugs:-->

<H5> Reporting bugs:</H5>If Unison is not working the way you expect, here are some steps to 
follow.
<UL>
<LI>
First, take a look at the Unison documentation, especially the
FAQ section. Lots of questions are answered there.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>Next, try running Unison with the <TT>-debug all</TT> command line
option. This will cause Unison to generate a detailed trace of what it's
doing, which may help pinpoint where the problem is occurring.<BR>
<BR>

<LI>If this doesn't clarify matters, try sending an email describing
your problem to the users list at
<A HREF="mailto:unison-users@groups.yahoo.com"><TT>unison-users@groups.yahoo.com</TT></A>. (Make sure you subscribe first, so
that you'll see people's responses in case they reply only to the list!)
Please include the version of Unison you are using (<TT>unison
 -version</TT>), the kind of machine(s) you are running it on, a record of
what gets printed when the <TT>-debug all</TT> option is included, and as
much information as you can about what went wrong.
</UL><!--TOC paragraph Feature Requests:-->

<H5> Feature Requests:</H5>Please post your feature requests, suggestions, etc. to the <B>unison-users</B> list. <BR>
