3) ITERABILITY

Astute readers/listeners will already have realized that the present
spec. doesn't give us any way to *iterate* the synchronizer, to
synchronize many times.  We can fix this by making a new memory part
of the output of the synchronizer:

Now, a synchronizer comprises
   a set       M
   a relation  describes subseteq M * FS * FS
   a relation  snc : M * FS * FS  *  M * FS * FS
such that
    if  OA-content = OB-content
        M describes OA,OB
        A follows OA and B follows OB
    and snc(M,A,B, M',A',B'),
    then
       for all paths p, (A) and (B), as before

       (C) there exist OA' and OB' such that

            - OA'-content = OB'-content
            - M' describes OA',OB'
            - A' follows OA' and B' follows OB'
            - for each path p in A' and B',
                * if A'(p)=B'(p)=DIR, then OA'(p)=OB'(p)=DIR
                * else if A'/p=B'/p, then OA'/p=OB'/p=OA/p
                * else OA'/p=A/p and OB'/p=OB/p

          ("M' correctly describes the last synchronized state of
            each path")


4) FAILURE

The next problem with the spec is that it is not implementable in the
presence of communication or system failures: the synchronizer may be
partway through propagating updates from one system to the other when
the user types Control-C or the modem gets unplugged.

Note that if the filesystem supports transactions, then in principle
we don't need to do anything about this: we just make the whole
propagation (including updating M) into one big transaction.  If a
failure happens in the middle, the system sorts things out so that
either we complete normally as described above or it is as if the
synchronizer never ran.

Unfortunately, current filesystems do not support transactions, so we
need to weaken the specification.  However, we do not want the
specification to be so weak that it allows *any* behavior in the
presence of failures.  We need to give the user some guarantees about
what state the replicas (and memory!) might be in.  To this end, we
introduce the notion of failure explicitly into the spec:

Now, a synchronizer comprises
   a set       M
   a relation  describes subseteq M * FS * FS
   a relation  snc : M * FS * FS  *  M * FS * FS  *  BOOL
such that
    if  OA-content = OB-content
        M describes OA,OB
        A follows OA and B follows OB
    and snc(M,A,B, M',A',B', FAILURE),
    then
      (A) and (B) as before

      (C') either FAILURE and M'=M
           or (C) as before
