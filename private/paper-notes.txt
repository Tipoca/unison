BTW this stuff about atomicity belongs in the paper.  In this case we
want an atomic open of a temp file in a particular directory, or an
atomic rename to a temp file in a directory.  We need it to be in the
same directory because atomic renames aren't allowed across drives...

We should try to list out the atomic operations we'd like to have from
the file system and include this list in the paper.  As you guys come
across others let's all post them here, and maybe collect them
somewhere.
