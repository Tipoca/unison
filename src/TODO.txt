Here we list planned and imagined improvements to Unison.  Ones that we
regard as most important are marked with more *s.  (Unfortunately, since
Unison is no longer under active development [though it is still heavily
used by its original developers], the presence of a suggestion in this file
is not promise that anybody is going to implement it!)

See the file BUGS.txt for a list of currently open bugs.

**** The third assertion in Remote.fill_buffer failed for me (BCP) during a transfer!

**** Remaining problem with merging code: 
       - create two directories, each containing a .txt file
       - sync so they are equal
       - change the file so that one region is in conflict and another
         region has changes that can be propagated correctly
       - sync
       - now we should be able to change the second region in just one file, 
         sync again, and see the change propagate; instead, it conflicts
       - diagnosis: the merge stuff is not correctly updating the archive in
         the event of a partial reconciliation

**** When deleting a directory, we should *not* skip over Unison temp files
     in the process of listing children

*** make the ETA bar show which file is actually transferring bytes at the
    moment

*** Fix the pred module to understand negation and delete XXXnot predicates

*** Web
    - Add a "supported platforms" page mentioning system-specific stuff
    - Add an installation instructions page, removing it from the manual

*** See if we can get rid of some Osx.XXX stuff (e.g. ressLength!?)

*** Add the following to the Problems FAQ:

  I was right about the crucial circumstances of owner = group.  Moral:
  do not let user=group under Cygwin.  I know it causes a problem when
  you make unison use the full permissions model on Cygwin systems; I
  think this may also explain similar problems I had using the default
  unison behavior (which treats Cygwin files as read-only or read-write
  only) -- though there are several possible causes of like failures to
  syncrhonize permissions.  

  The answer is obvious, following from the basic handling of permissions
  in Cygwin (in NT permissions mode), but I didn't see it.  Users and
  groups to Windows are the same kind of object (SID), and permissions on
  a file or directory are represented as a list of (any number of) SIDs
  paired with permissions such as read, write, execute (and quite a few
  more).  When you try to map this to the Unix model of user and group,
  when the user and group happen to be the same, the user-permissions and
  the group-permissions are operating on the same underlying Windows
  object, and so they cannot be different.  I think the user-permissions
  prevail. 

  For example, if you try to sync a Unix file with permissions rw-r--r--
  with a Cygwin file with permissions rw-rw-r-- whose owner happens to be
  the same as the group, unison will report success, but the actual
  permissions will not be changed.  Moreover, during the next sync,
  unison will by default propogate the Cygwin file back to the Unix file,
  so that the degenerate permissions under Cygwin will migrate to the
  Unix system unless you are careful to prevent unison from doing it.
  (When you are trying to sync some 75,000 email and font files, this all
  is more than a little exasperating!) 

  ---

  Further important advice if you are going to synchronize Cygwin
  filesystems with unison's full Unix permissions model (and perhaps it
  is also important even with unison's default behavior): 

  Background:  the flags "ntsec" or "ntea" in the CYGWIN environment
  variable signals Cygwin's libraries to use the richer NT permissions
  model rather than a simplified Win95-98 model.  "ntsec" requires an
  NTFS filesystem, "ntea" will work with FAT filesystems.  I use
  "ntsec". 

  If unison does not have CYGWIN set appropriately in its environment,
  some chmod calls will not do the expected thing, even though they
  return with success.  This will result in the file coming up again in
  the next synchronization, and unison will then by default propagate the
  (wrong) permissions from the Cygwin file back to the Unix system.  (The
  first chmod apparently succeeded, so unison records the new permissions
  in its archive; the second time, when the file does not match the
  archive, it seems to unison that the Cygwin file has been changed.) 

  If you run unison from the bash command line, you will most likely not
  have a problem, since CYGWIN is probably set appropriately and exported
  in the .bat script that launches bash.  Likewise, when the Cygwin
  filesystem is the remote one, Cygwin's sshd is by default set up (by
  /usr/bin/ssh-host-config) to establish and export an appropriate value
  of CYGWIN to ssh clients. 

  If you launch unison directly from a Windows shortcut, however, you
  must set CYGWIN in your Windows environment variables.  This is
  certainly a convenient way to launch unison either with a particular
  profile or generically.  The instructions for setting up Cygwin and the
  discussions of the CYGWIN envariable in the user manual never mention
  any need to put CYGWIN in the Windows envariables, however. (I'm
  writing them to suggest they do.) 

  >From the unison standpoint, the code which chooses to use the full
  permissions model on Cygwin hosts (right now I have it hacked simply to
  always use full permissions, by commenting out a line) perhaps ought to
  confirm that "ntsec" or "ntea" is in the CYGWIN envariable and issue a
  big warning that permissions may not be properly synchronized if
  neither value is there.


BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

** 'make install' could be improved (and documented)
   1. Typing "make install' after a "make" should simply install the 
   program that was made, not attempt to do a remake with different options.
   ===> Doesn't it???
   2. "make install' should try to install as /usr/local/bin/unison, not 
   ~/bin/, especially considering that ~/bin is the wrong place to do the 
   install under OSX (it should be ~/Apps or ~/Apps/bin)

** document the dynamic linked version, as some user already reported
  that it works fine.  Also, try to make the statistics window work with
  this version.  [This is "under windows," I think.]

* if unison is dynamically linked, can we check from the -version
  that all the libraries are present and working?  can we check the
  status of threading?  mention in the manual what happens if one side
  is threaded and the other is not.

should strip symbols from binary files in 'make exportnative'


DOCUMENTATION
=============

** Put a little more order on the flags and preferences -- e.g.,
    organize them into "basic preferences", "advanced preferences,"
    "expert preferences," etc.  Requires hacking the Uarg module.

** Add something to docs about how to use 'rootalias'.  Include an
   explanation of the semantics, a couple of examples, and a suggestion
   for how to debug what it's doing by turning on appropriate debugging
   flags.  (And maybe we should actually make the debug output there a
   bit more verbose?)

** Misc:
  - document good trick: use -1 switch to ssh if the paths are set up wrong
    on the remote host
  - should say whether trailing slashes are ok for paths; should say
    that leading slashes are illegal.
    ===> check
  - not so clear what you have to do with a Regex to match a directory
    and all its subfiles: foo or foo/ or foo/.* ?
    ===> the first. document it.  (Does foo/ match foo?  I don't think so.
         Document, one way or the other.)
  - what happens when files are included whose parent dirs are
    excluded? (With Regex?  With multiple Path and Name?)
    ===> document
  - the documentation is very good, but i couldn't find a description of how 
    to respond to the prompts in the textual ui. is that explained 
    somewhere? a few typos i noticed: "with t fast", "nison", "off of".

** what happens when we ssh through loopback and sync the same
   directory?
   ===> Needs to be thought about.  In particular, what is the name of the
        archive in this case?  Could they ever be exactly the same?
   ===> Try it and see.


SMALL FUNCTIONALITY IMPROVEMENTS
================================

**** The archive should indicate whether it is case-dependant or not.
     (This is important for correctness -- if the case-insensitive flag is
     set differently on different runs, things can get very confused!)

**** Use LargeFile (submodule of Unix) instead of standard file commands,
     to avoid problems with huge files
     DONE

*** Delete old backups mechanism and, instead, extend new one to cover its
    functionality 
       - put backups in same dir as files by default
       - otherwise, put them in a central place if one is given
       - Update.incrVersionsOfBackups should not be externally visible

*** there's an HFS+ aware version of rsync called rsyncx. It should be
    relatively easy to import that functionality into unison.

*** Put in a call to Gc.compact in the memory stats command.  Consider
    putting it in the normal "do it again" command loop.
    ===> Is this still an issue ?

*** unison -help doesn't go to stdout so it's hard to pipe it into less
    ===> Probably *all* output should go to stdout, not stderr (but maybe
         we need a switch to recover the current behavior)

*** for the MSVC version of unison, we should deal with the nonstandard
    semantics regarding read-only files.
    ===> What does that mean??

*** If a root resides on a `host' with an ever and unpredictably changing
    host name (like a public login cluster with dozens of machines and a
    shared file system), listing each possible host name for this root is
    not feasible.  The ability of specifing patterns in rootaliases would
    help a lot in this case.  I'm thinking of something like this:
    rootalias = //.*//afs/cern.ch/user/n/nagya ->
    //cern.ch//afs/cern.ch/user/n/nagya [NAGY Andras <nagya@inf.elte.hu>,
    March 12]
    ===> We definitely ought to do something about this problem -- it's
         increasingly common.  Not sure if this is the right proposal, but 
         something. 

*** Currently, if a file changes on either side between the initial update
    detection and the time when the transport module tries to propagate
    changes, the transport is aborted.  But if the change occurred on the
    replica that is being used as the source for the transfer (which will
    be the common case!), then there is no reason to abort -- we should
    just propagate the newest version.

*** When unison notices lock files in the archive directory, it should
    offer to delete them *for* the user, rather than forcing the user to
    delete them manually.

*** improve error reporting when Unison is started with different versions of
    client and server

*** A switch to delete files before replication. It's not something I
    would have considered doing, and in normal replication, there have
    already been pointed out good reasons why Unison works the way it
    does, but Roman makes a good reason for why this is useful in CD-RW
    backups, and why this could be useful on a general to do list. And
    this is certainly *generic*, which my point is not (as it only applies
    to the Microsoft Windows NTFS situation).

*** A switch to include NTFS ACE/ACL file permissions to be copied when
    copying from one NTFS location to another NTFS location. As I
    mentioned this is less generic, but of fundamental usefullness in
    Windows usage, as NTFS permissions are absolutely essential in many
    backup/replication situations in Windows systems. Robocopy has the
    /SEC switch, but Unison is a far better tool, and I was hoping in that
    light that Unison could implement the rights/permissions stuff also.

*** There is no command-line argument to tell Unison where the .unison
    directory is; Unison finds it in the environment or not at all.  I was
    able to workaround this with a symbolic link to put .unison where it was
    expected, but it seems like an easy option to add.

*** The other is possibly a bit more difficult, but more useful as well.  There
    is a brief window of vulnerability between when the local server is started
    and when the remote client connects to it.  (It's no longer than that
    because Unison won't take more than one connection at a time.)  I can
    tolerate it, but the window could be eliminated entirely by allowing socket
    connections to require a nonce.

** Would be nice to transfer directories "incrementally" rather than
   atomically (i.e., if Unison is interrupted during the transfer of a
   directory, the partially-transferred directory should persist).  Is
   this allowed by the specification?  (If so, then it should just become
   the default behavior.)
   ===> BCP and William Lovas have discussed how to do this, but it is
        not all that straightforward.

** we should reload the current preference file (if it's changed, at least)
   when we restart

** [A good idea for the ssh prompt issue...]  I'm not sure why you would
  need a C implementation; you could do the same thing in CAML that expect
  does: allocate a PTY, start up ssh on that, and interact with it. On
  Windows, you can probably do the same with the Win32 console API,
  although I don't see why such an improvement needs to work uniformly
  across all platforms to be useful.  [Note that allocating PTYs is not
  very portable, but we could at least try allocating one and see if
  something useful comes back...]

** An idea for the interface to the external merge functionality:
  created a general mechanism for invoking external functionality...
    - in profile, declare a command of the form
           key M = external "merge ##1 ##2 ###" --> overwriting originals
      (concrete syntax open to discussion!).  Main parts are
         - what key to bind it to in the UI(s)
         - the command line to start up
         - variables (##1 and ##2) for the local and remote files
           (the remote file will automatically be copied to a local temp
           file, if this variable is used)
         - a variable (###) for a temporary output file
         - an indication of what to do with this output file
           (or maybe this could be automatic)
         - (should also indicate which machine(s) to run the command on?)

** small additions to merge functionality:
  - if the external merge program *deletes* one of the files it is given,
    Unison should interpret this as "Copy the other file onto this location
    (instead of merging)".  This will allow some other interesting 
    functionality, e.g. external programs that may decide to keep both
    versions by moving one of them out of the way (mh-rename).
  - the invocation of the external 'diff' program should be selectable
    using the same conventions as the 'merge' program
  - would be nice to be able to invoke DIFFERENT merge programs
    depending on paths

** We should document other available merge tools, e.g., 
   idiff [BCP has a copy of the code for idiff that Norman sent.]  

** Allow 'default.prf' in place of 'default' for profile names

** [dlux@dlux.hu, Feb 2002] For some apps (e.g., some mail readers?),
  putting temp files in the same directory as the file we're about to
  overwrite is bad/dangerous. Some alternatives that we could
  consider... 
    -  Add a configuration option for temporary directory and notice the
       user about the volume restrictions in the docs and then if the user
       does not consider it, then we use a non-atomic (copy + unlink)
       rename. In an ideal environment (where the user consider this
       restriction), it makes possible to sync a maildir folder while it is
       online!
    -  An even better solution: One more temporary file step. If the user
       sets the temporary directory, then we synchronize the files to that
       directory, and if the file is downloaded/uploaded fully, then we move
       it to a tempfile into the target directory (with .unison.tmp
       extension) and then rename it into the final name.

** Suggestion for extending merge functionality
     - add a new kind of preference -- a conditional stringlist preference
     - in the preference file, each value looks like either
            prefname = string
       or
            prefname = string WHEN Path PPPPP 
            prefname = string WHEN Name XXXXX
            prefname = string WHEN Regex XXXXX
     - when we look up such a preference, we provide a current path, and it
       returns the one that matches the current path, if any 

** Would be good to (optionally) change the semantics of the "backup"
   functionality, so that Unison would not insist on making a *full*
   backup of the whole replica, but just do so lazily.  (I.e., it would
   not make backups when files get put into the archive, but only when
   they actually get changed.)

** Would also be nice to allow the backup preference to be set
   differently on different hosts -- so that all the backups could be
   kept on one side (if there is no space on the other side, e.g.).  The
   obvious way to do this is to add a switch like '-suppressbackupsonroot
   BLAH' but this feels a bit ad hoc.  It would be nicer to decide, in
   general, which preferences can sensibly have different settings on
   different roots (e.g., the location of the archive dir, ...) and
   provide a general mechanism for setting them per-host.

** ~/foo seems to work on the command line but not in root = ~/foo in the
   config file.
   --
   Similarly: It seems that when one specifies logfile = foobar
   in the preferences file, then unison assumes that it is relative to the
   current directory. Since neither ~ nor $HOME are understood in the
   preference file, this is an inconvenience, because it forces the user to
   remember to run unison from the root directory.
   ===> Would be nice to support ~ internally

** giving a -path preference whose parent dir doesn't exist currently causes
   Unison to abort with a fatal error.  Would be better if it just
   signalled an error for that file.

** no spec for escaping regexp chars; spaces? newlines? tabs? others?
   mechanism for getting the list of files from another program (plugin)?
   ===> needs to be documented (look at rx.ml)

** seems not to recognise ignores when they are inside a path that has
   just been added.
===> Jamey claims that if we add a new directory, some of whose children
     are ignored, then when this new dir is propagated, also the ignored
     stuff gets copied  (if this is true, then it's probably a bug in
     update.ml) 

* When loading archives (not just when dumping them), one should check that
  they have the same checksum.

* [July 2002, S. Garfinkel] Maybe we should turn the 'time' option on by
  default.  We might need to help people a little on the upgrading,
  though.  When you did a sync with time=false, then a sync with
  time=true, you get a zillion conflicts...
     ==> This is probably a good idea, but I'm a little scared of all the
         messages we'd get from upgrading users

* Maybe we should write debugging and tracing information to stdout
  instead of stderr?

* URI pathname syntax
  Why is the following command wrong?
     unison -servercmd `which unison` /usr/local ssh://labrador/usr/local
  It took me three tries and careful reading of the documentation to
  figure it out.  I don't have any good suggestions here, other than
  that I think the whole issue of relative vs absolute pathnames needs
  serious thought.  I think the current interfaces do not work very
  well.  One possibility that I will float is that you invent a special
  character string to refer to the root of synchronization.
  E.g., interpret ~ as $HOME in roots.
  --
  Also: we should add the file:// syntax to URIs...
    file://C:/Necula    (C:/Necula on the local file system)
    file:////share/subdir  (//share/subdir as from the point of view of
                          the local file system)
    unison://host///share/subdir
  -- 
  Should local roots in a profile be canonized?
    Right now, we can have a relative root in the profile.  This
    is going to be a problem if unison is started in a different
    directory.

* At the moment, if Unison is interrupted during a non-atomic operation
  on the file system, the user has to clean things up manually, following
  the instructions in the the recovery log.  We should do that for them.
  (This is actually a bit tricky, since we need to be careful about what
  might happen if unison crashes during recovery, etc.  The best way to
  accomplish this would be to write a general logging/recovery facility
  in OCaml.)

* Dealing with ACLs: Maybe this is what we should do actually.  We could
  specify a user (and similarly a group) to unison.  It would be
  interpreted in a special way: if a file is owned by this user, unison
  will rather consider that the owner of the file is undefined.  So, when
  a file owned by an unkown user is synchronized, the file owner is set
  to the default user.  Then, on the next synchronizations, unison will
  consider that the owner has not been propagated and try again.  [Should
  be easy once the reconciler is made more modular]

* The -terse preference should suppress more (in fact, almost all)
  messages in the text ui.  See Dale Worley's message for a detailed
  proposal. 

Make sure that no filesystem check is missing in the transport agent.
  ===> What does this mean?

Would be nice to have the Unison log file relative to my home directory,
 like this 
       logfile = ~/.unision/log
  or
       logfile = $HOME/.unision/log
  (We should do this for *all* files that the user specifies.)

It would be nice if Unison could have the "power" to copy write-protected
   files, maybe as an option.

Update checking over NFS might be *much* faster if we use only relative
  pathnames (absolute paths may require an RPC per level!?)

On Saul, Unison seems to use HUGE amounts of memory (250Mb resident),
  while on my laptop it's much less.  WTF?

[Ben Wong, Aug 2002] Why not make unison fall back to addversionno if it
  would otherwise bomb out with an incorrect version number? That way I
  wouldn't have to educate people on how to use Unison at my site; it'd
  "just work".

The -sortbysize is nice, but what I would really like is a -limitbysize.
  When I'm connected over a modem line, I would like not to transfer the
  larger files that need synchronization. That can wait until I am
  connected via a faster connection. What I presently do is allow unison
  to run in -sortbysize mode, and abort once I have all my little, more
  important files. -limitbysize should simply filter the list of transfer
  to only those that are below the threshold size. The syntax is
  obvious... It should be -limitbysize xxx, where xxx is the size
  (preferably in kb, but bytes will do as well).

Maybe we should use getcwd for canonizing roots under Unix.  For some
  systems (Linux, for instance), getcwd succeeds even when some parent
  directory is not readable.

[From Yan Seiner]
  Can unison modify the (*nix) environment to show the
  ip/name/some_other_id of the system making the connection?  This would
  help tremendously.
  For example, vtun does this:
  ---
  root      6319  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug27   0:37 vtund[s]:
  bgsludge tun tun10
  root      6324  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug27   2:00 vtund[s]:
  cardinal tun tun0
  root     17001  0.0  0.6  1984  848 ?        S<   Aug27   0:05 vtund[s]:
  wtseller tun tun11
  root     20100  0.0  0.6  1984  852 ?        S<   Aug28   0:02 vtund[s]:
  cardridg tun tun1
  ----
  So I know I have four sessions, to each named machine, and I know
  immediately who is connected and who is not.  If I have to kill a
  session, I don't kill the wrong one.

add a switch '-logerrors' that makes unison log error messages to a
  separate file in addition to the standard logfile

Dale Worley's suggestion for relocating archives:
  >   You're right: it's not all that tricky.  So would you be happy if you
  >   could run unison in a special mode like this
  >       unison -relocate //old-host1//path1 //old-host2//path2 \
  >                        //new-host1//path1 //new-host2//path2
  >   (where all the hosts and paths are normalized) and it would move the
  >   archives for you on both machines?
  Actually, I think that what you want is for the user to specify the
  old paths in *normalized* form and the new paths in *non-normalized*
  form.  That is, unison uses the old paths literally as provided by the
  user, but it applies the usual normalization algorithm to the new
  paths.
  This may sound strange, but I think that it's the Right Thing:
  - There is no guarantee that the normalization algorithm, applied to
    the old paths as the user used to specify them, normalizes to the
    the normalized paths that are recorded in the archive.  Indeed,
    there may no longer be *any* path which normalizes to the recorded
    paths.
  - The user can extract the normalized old paths from the second line
    of the archive files.  This is clumsy, but reliable.  And we don't
    intend the user to relocate an archive very often.
  - But for the new paths, you want to normalize what the user supplies,
    because he doesn't know in advance how Unison is going to normalize
    the new paths, and may well specify them incorrectly.  That would
    leave him with a relocated archive that he might not be able to use
    at all.
  You might want to put quotes around the pathnames in the second line
  of the archive, since MS-Windows directory names can contain spaces,
  etc.

For safety...
  - Add a preference 'maxdelete' taking an integer parameter, default 100
    (or perhaps even less -- keeping it fairly small will help naive users
    avoid shooting themselves in the foot).  A negative number means
    skip this check (i.e., infinity).
  - When the transport subsystem gets control (i.e., just after the user
    says 'go' to the user interface, when not running in batch mode)
    it first checks the number of files that are going to be deleted
    (including all the contents of any directories that are marked for
    deletion).  If it is more than maxdelete (and maxdelete is
    positive), then...
       - If we're in batch mode (batch=true), we halt without doing
         anything.
       - If we're not in batch mode, we display a warning message and
         make the user confirm.  (If they do *not* confirm, it would be
         nice to dump them back into the user interface again, but this
         would require a little rewriting of our control flow.)
  - Would also be nice to include a display in the UI someplace that says
    how many files are to be deleted/changed/created plus how many bytes
    to be transferred, and a warning signal (display in red or something)
    if these exceed the current setting of maxdelete.

Might be nice to provide an option that says "if you're propagating a
  newly created directory and something goes wrong with something inside
  it, just ignore the file that failed and keep going with the rest of
  the directory."  [We probably don't want to continue in all cases (for
  instance, when the disk is full)]

Would be nice to be able to run unison in a special mode like this
    unison -relocate //old-host1//path1 //old-host2//path2 \
                     //new-host1//path1 //new-host2//path2
  (where all the hosts and paths are canonized) and have it move the
  archives for you on both machines?

It would be nice if unison had a tool by which it could regenerate all
  the MD5 sums and compare them to what it has stored, then produce a list
  of files that are different.  I obviously cannot count on file size and
  date in  this case; those may not have changed but the contents may be
  corrupt.

If the connection to the server goes away and then comes back up, it
  would be nice if Unison would transparently re-establish it (at least,
  when this makes sense!)

If we synchronize a path whose parent doesn't exist in one replica, we'll
  fail.  Might be nicer to create the parent path if needed.

maybe put backup files somewhere other than in the replica (e.g. in
  $HOME/tmp, or controlled by preference)

Better documentation of the -backups flag, and a way to expire old backups

Add a preference that makes the reconciler ignore prefs-only differences 
  between files (not updating the archive, though -- just suppressing
  the difference -- will this slow things down too much??  Maybe it needs
  to happen in the update detector, before things are transmitted across
  the network.)

Perhaps we should interpret both / and the local separator as path
  separators, i.e., under Windows / and \, under Mac / and :, and under
  Unix just /.  For Windows this will be fine, since / is not allowed in
  filenames.

Maybe have an option to tell do not transfer toto.dvi if toto.tex exists (or
  toto.ps if toto.dvi): something like
          Ignore .dvi If .tex
  ===> This is not a good idea -- would give different ignore results on
  the two machines.  But maybe a variant would work:
    - Have an option to execute a command if a given file exist like
            Execute rm core If core
            Execute make clean If Makefile

We should put in a preference that forces Unison to do really safe update
  detection (with fingerprinting), even on Unix systems.  (Maybe just for
  some paths?)

Maybe we should never emit a conflict for modtimes; instead, we just
  propagate the largest one.

[John Langford] Some code for (at least partially) handling large files
  can be found in 64bit_ops.c in:

  Make sure you pay attention to the compile line as it is important.


USER INTERFACE
==============

** In menu Actions
    - show Diff applies to the current line, while
    - revert to unision's recommandation applies to all lines 
   Should be clearer and/or homogeneous behavior.
   I would also like to have "revert to unision's recommandation" for the
   current line. 

** in gtk ui, display green checkmark next to finished items even if their
   direction indicates a conflict; do not list such items as "skipped" at
   the end

** In both UIs, show how many bytes/files were successfully transferred
   at the end 

** Should support auto-termination of the graphical UI (switch-controlled)
    * Unison starts in the usual way and checks for changes
    * If there are no conflicts, it proceeds without waiting for confirmation
    * If there *are* conflicts, it waits for instructions, just like now
    * In either case, when it's finished transferring the changes, it quits

* [Matthew Swift] in the GTK gui at least,
  display the total MB or #files or whatever it is that the ticking
  %-meter is referring to when it goes from 0 to 100.  it is useful to
  know how big the xfer is going to be before starting it (might induce me
  to choose "sort by size", or abandon and choose a smaller subset, etc.).
  Also, esp. since the gui is single-threaded and unresponsive, i would
  like to know what size of a synch that I am for example 50% or 22%
  through.  I know that an ETA and other things we're used to from many
  downloading apps would require quite a bit of code, but it would help a
  lot just to display whatever constant is represented by 100%.


* [BCP] Error reporting for per-file problems during updating leaves
  something to be desired.  In particular, there's no indication even of
  which host the problem occurred on.  (I added something that includes
  "root 1" or "root 2", but I'm not sure that's better than nothing.)  If
  there are errors on both hosts, only one will be reported.  If there
  are lots of errors in a subdir, only the first will be reported.
  Recon.propagateUpdates would be a starting point for changes.

* [Jamey Leifer] 
  Would be nice if both UIs had a "revert to Unison's proposal" button...

* [Jamey Leifer] 
  [graphic ui, wishlist] The documentation topics aren't searchable.  As
  a result "unison -doc running | less" is still indispensable if one
  wants to find anything.  I suggest adding a box

     "search in this topic: ---"

  which is always available in the doc viewer.  It would be nice to
  support keyboard shortcuts in the "less" style, namely "/", "n", and
  "N" (i.e. search, next, previous) to avoid too much clicking.

  [graphic ui, wishlist] Ditto as far as searchability for diff reports.

* Would be nice to have a keystroke in the UI that means 'add the current
  directory to the set of ignore patterns.'

* In the text UI, during the transport phase, print each file being
  transferred on *one* line, with an arrow to indicate which way (and
  dropping the explicit indication of which host from and to).  The
  logfile should be more explicit.

* The unison gui currently displays a percentage completion in the lower right
  corner.  I would find it comforting if it would also display an effective
  bandwidth there, i.e., how many bits per second are flowing through the
  transport layer?  I make this request because owing to a hardware 
  catastrophe, I have just started using Unison through the phone lines, and
  it seems to do nothing for a long period of time.  I don't know whether
  to blame the cheap modem, the cheap ISP, or whether Unison simply isn't
  telling me that bits are flowing through the wire.  (netstat -tn
  suggests not much is happening, but I don't know if the results can
  be trusted.)

* Would it be hard to add "tool tips" to the buttons in the UI?
  ==> Look for "tooltip" in examples/testgtk.ml.
      The easiest way is with a toolbar, but you can also add tooltips to any
      widget (cf lines 867 and after).

* > On a line, I would like to have a description of the action to be taken in
  > clear words: (e.g. will erase file on local or will copy from local to
  > remote, etc.)
  This might be a good use for "tool tips," if I knew how to make them work
  using lablGTK.

* After clicking "Create new profile" in the initial profile window and
  giving a name for the new profile, it is confusing to get dumped back
  into the profile window again and have to explicitly select the new
  profile.  Would be better to skip this step and go straight into
  filling in its fields.

* Another usability issue in the text UI: , and < should mean the same to
  unison. It would be nice if both had the same representation on-screen
  (ie, show a "<" even if I typed a ","). Similarly for . and >.

* The menu help for left/right arrow both said `transfer local to local'.
  Not helpful.  The items in question are pathnames, which you might not
  have to abbreviate.  To save space one might consider replacing any
  common prefix, and also short prefixes that look like they might be
  automounter goo, with an ellipsis.  Then show, e.g., 20 chars.  I'd
  also be willing to name paths in my profile, e.g., replica flatcoat =
  /home/cellar/nr replica cellar = /m/cellar60/nr This would be
  especially attractive if my short names were meaningful on the command
  line.

* In the GTK user interface, it would be nice to be able to put up a window 
  displaying the contents of the log file (and add log messages to it
  dynamically as we're working).  Be careful, though: the log could get
  large and we don't want this to be too slow. 

* Could there be an option between -ui text and -ui graphic that when combine
  with -batch and -auto would start in text mode, but pop up an interactive
  graphic window when real conflicts happens.

* [Jamey Leifer] I think "unison -doc" should be mapped to "unison
  -doc topics" and the error message for the former eliminated.

* [Jamey Leifer] Typing "unison" results in the Profiles box
  ("Select an existing profile...").  I think the help topics should be
  available here.

* [Jamey Leifer] The file list is confusing since the paths
  are sometime relative to the root and sometimes relative to the
  previous path:
     Mail/drafts/3
       inbox/5538
         5539
         5540
  I now understand that the indentation is significant, but it's not
  that clear. A further confusion is that there's varying amounts of
  indentation depending on the depth of the enclosing path:
     foo/1
       2
     boo/goo/loo/1
           3
           4
  This is really hard to parse since the fonts are variable width.
  I would prefer to read the former as:
     Mail/drafts/3
          inbox/5538
                5539
                5540
  (with the indentation actually showing the relationship) though this
  may take too much horizontal space.  Alternatively, one could choose a
  Windows-style display:
   |-Mail/drafts/3
     |-inbox/5538
       |- 5539
       |- 5540

Unison's gui offers an `Actions' menu with a variety of features
  regarding preferences.  I would love to see an action with the following
  semantics: if the two files differ only in their modification time,
  prefer the older modification time.
  ===> This would be easy to add, but I am beginning to worry that we are
       getting too many funny little switches like this.  We should think
       about them all together and make sure they make sense.

I'm watching it sync a very large file that I don't want anyway, and I'm in
  a hurry. I'd like a way to say "forget that file, I don't care about it, go
  on to the next one you have to sync". Doesn't sound hard...?
  [Perdita Stevens, Perdita.Stevens@dcs.ed.ac.uk, Mar 14 2002]
  ===> It's not trivial (involves some subtle stuff about our RPC
       implementation and the single-thread nature of the GUI), but might
       not be impossible either. 

"Quit" during synchronization should abort all current operations (so
  that temporary files are deleted) before exiting.
  ===> Again, requires some careful thinking about how this would work
       with the RPC layer.

It would be nice to have a command in the GUI that would allow a single
  path within the replica to be selected from a file dialog and
  synchronized.

The scroll bar is not usable during transport: every time a line changes
  in the list, the display jumps to that line; if many small files are
  transfered, it makes browsing in the list quite impossible...  

[From Manuel Serrano] Would be nice to put the arrows in different
  directions in different colors, so that, e.g., you could quickly scan the
  list of changes and make sure that they are all in the same direction
  ===> We tried this, but we couldn't find color combinations that did not
  seem confusing.  (Two different shades of green?  Three? ...)  If we
  really want this, probably the best is to put in some preferences for the
  user to control the colors of all the arrows individually.

Under Windows, convert filename to Unicode before printing them.

Text mode user interface should be brought up to date with graphical
  interface (it should prompt for profile selection, creation, root
  entry, etc.; command characters should be the same; ...)

Since the manual is pretty big, it would be nice if the on-line version
  were accessible through cascading menus, allowing direct access to
  individual subsections.  It would also be nice if it were formatted a
  bit more attractively, using proportional-width fonts, etc.  (Does GTK
  have something like an RTF widget?)

If I have a change I look at the detail window. It would be nice to be
  able to click on one of the lines there instead of pressing one of <-
  or ->. For one thing in the detail window the relative position of the
  two files is up and down and translating that to <- or -> is somewhat
  unintuitive.

Also, it would be nice to highlight in the detailed window the
   elements that have changed.

Make it possible to select a bunch of conflicts at the same time and
  override them all together

The UI window should display the current roots somewhere.

There should be a -geometry command-line interface, following the usual X
  conventions. 

put in a command-line option that makes fatal errors exit right away
  without displaying anything in the graphical UI (for debugging)

Use the CTree widget to display the list of files
  Add the ability to close and open directories in the UI.

it would be nice to give a visual indication of which files are
  particularly big, so that the user can tell where the transfer
  operations may get slowed down.  Maybe a "size bar" showing the log
  of the size (perhaps also color coded). 
  ===> less urgent now because we can re-sort the update items by size

Would it be hard to allow long-running transfers to be aborted?
  For instance, the key "/" aborts the transmission of the selected file
  OR:
  Allow the user to terminate individual operations by clicking a
  "cancel" button.  (This is not completely straightforward because
  the whole program is single-threaded.  But it should be possible for
  the low-level transport code in remote.ml to realize that the
  operation has been aborted, clean up, and raise an exception.)

It would be nice if the initial 'usage' message were not so long.  Maybe
  we could split options into 'novice' and 'expert' ones, and only print
  the novice ones (with an indication how to obtain the full expert
  printout).

> Show diff should behave as an emacs view-mode buffer and quit on a single

The UI for the diff functionality needs some polishing.  (Also, it should
be merged with the new "merge" functionality.)

consider separating switches into 'ordinary' and 'expert' categories,
  documented in separate sections

would be nice to be able to "Proceed" just the selected line

might be nice if the GUI would beep when finished syncing (needs to be
  switch-selectable and off by default, naturally).  Is this easy with
  LablGTK? 

It would be nice to be able to STOP the GUI in the middle of propagating
  changes.  


TIDYING
=======

** remove ourlablgtk from the distribution

* Tidying
    - divide files into subdirs

* Go through the sources and make all fatal and transient error messages
  as informative as possible 

Make the sources available by anonymous CVS (maybe from SourceForge)

More documentation (especially in the interface files) is always nice.
  In particular, there isn't enough documentation of the big picture.
  It isn't clear how to fit together archives, servers, paths, roots, 
  update detection, reconciliation, conflict resolution, or the user 
  interface...

Ocamlexc v1.0, the uncaught exceptions analyzer for Objective Caml is now
  available from Pessaux's home page.  It would be fun to run it over the
  Unison sources and see if it reveals any problems.


LARGER EXTENSIONS
=================

Fast update checking would be cool... Some resources:
   FAM (used in Enlightenment) 
   dnotify (linux 2.4)
   BSD kqueue
   the "VFS stacking layer" implemented by a guy at Columbia

[From JMS] 
  Some update detection speed improvement suggestions:
  - Read the FFS (Fast Filesystem) paper for hints
  - change the working directory instead of using absolute paths; this
    avoids calls to the evil iname(?) facility in the kernel
  - work breadth-first instead of depth first, to keep things in the
    kernel cache

Rewrite recon.ml in a more modular way.  Probably, have for each property
  a function taking the previous file state and the state on each
  replicas, and returning in what the synchronization operation should be
  (nothing, left, right, conflict); a combinator then merge the results.

It would be good to have a graphical interface allowing management and
  editing of profiles, ignore patterns, etc.  Or, less ambitiously, just
  have UI options for all command-line options (killServer) 

How about a facility so that you can specify more than one pair of
  file systems for a single invocation of Unison? This would be like
  calling Unison multiple times, except that it would ask all the
  questions at once.  Better yet, we could actually deal with the
  multi-replica case.  (The latter is pretty hard.)

What about invoking some user-specified operation on each file as it
  is transferred?  Or in each directory where things have changed?
  (This will require some careful design work.)

Sync with archived directories (in tar / zip / gz format) would be
  nice.  Seems a bit awkward to implement, though: at the moment there
  are a lot of functions all over the place that investigate and
  modify the file system, and these would all have to be replaced with
  a layer that transparently parses, etc., etc.

Consider using other authentication services (e.g. Kerberos) instead
  of / in addition to ssh.

What happens when we synchronize, then decide to ignore some existing file
  What happens to the entry in the archive?  If mirroring, it may be
  large, we probably want to delete it from the archive.

File level synchronization (bookmarks, mailboxes)

It might be nice to implement an (optional) safety check that detects
  aliasing within a replica due to followed links (or hard links) and
  complains if it finds any.  This should not be *too* expensive, since
  we already know all the inode numbers.  (Even if it *is* expensive, it
  might be useful to allow users to do this occasionally, if they are
  paranoid.) 


WINDOWS ISSUES
==============

Suggestion from Arnaud:
  I have been using XP for a while and despite all the problems I have, there
  is a very nice feature: being able to mount remote folders (nothing new), to
  work with them offline and synchronize them. Really useful.
  -- 
  A good way to simulate this with Unison would be to package it as a shell
  extension. From the desktop by clicking on the right button the user selects
  "create new Unison mount point" and answers a few trivial question. And the
  rest is done in the background. There are a lot of examples of shell
  extensions and there is a really good book for O'Reilly about it.
  -- 
  A good project for a student :-)
  -- 
  PS: see http://www.simplythebest.net/shellenh.html for some examples.

when typing ctrl-c in windows (dos-window in win98SE) when
  unison is asking for conflicting updates there araises following
  message (sorry for my bad translation to english):
  "This program is closes because of a non-valid action. Contact the
  manufactura if the error remains".                            

NTFS seems to have two ways of setting a file read-only!  
Comments from Karl Moerder:
    Tonight I made some files read-only on my desktop at home. I did this by
    setting global read and execute permissions (from the security tab of
    properties). I ran Unison and it didn't notice the change. I then set
    the permissions back to full control and then selected the read-only box
    (from the general tab of properties). I ran Unison again and it noticed
    and pushed the perms change to the server.
    I understand that Windows is a bit squirrely here, but how do you decide
    which permissions to look at? It seems like perhaps the ones on the
    security tab would be more natural. (?)
    --
    I get similar results with both bits (they both cause read-only
    behavior).
    I believe that the origin of the two modes of setting is that the first
    set is the old way of doing Windows protection (probably the interface
    provided on FAT file systems) and the new way is the more Unix like way
    (added for NTFS file systems). The new way has rwxdpo bits for each
    group (and there can be several groups).
