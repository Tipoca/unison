CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.46.1

* More robust file watching helper programs for Windows and Linux.
  They communicate with Unison through pipes (Unison redirects stdin
  and stdout), using a race-free protocol.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.46.0

* Added a "copyonconflict" preference, to make a copy of files that would
  otherwise be overwritten or deleted in case of conflicting changes.
  (This makes it possible to automatically resolve conflicts in a
   fairly safe way when synchronizing continuously, in combination
   with the "repeat = watch" and "prefer = newer" preferences.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.46.-1

* Bumped version number: incompatible protocol changes
* Improvements to the file watching functionality:
  - retries paths with failures using an exponential backoff algorithm
  - the information returned by the file watchers are used
    independently for each replica; thus, when only one replica has
    changes, Unison will only rescan this replica
  - when available, used by the graphical UIs to speed up rescanning
    (can be disabled by setting the new 'watch' preference to false)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.15

* transfer.ml: updated debugging code; in particular, turns an
  assertion failure into a more friendly transient failure

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.14

* Function External.readChannelTillEof now tail recursive
  (prevents a crash when the output of the diff program is too large)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.13

* Fixed Makefile for cross-compiling towards Windows (updated to MinGW-w64)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.12

* fsmonitor.py: fixed busy wait under Windows
* fsmonitor.py: make sure this helper program exits when Unison terminates
  (now, fsmonitor.py exits when stdin is closed, and Unison redirects stdin)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.11

* Fix bug in Lwt_unix.sleep

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.9

* Added some more debugging code in transfer.ml
-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.45.7

* Small fix to the way fsmonitor.py gets invoked when using the file
  watching functionality, suggested by Josh Berdine.  Unison will now
  look for fsmonitor.py in the same directory where the Unison
  executable itself lives.
