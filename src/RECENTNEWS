CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.5

* Truncate inode numbers to 31 bits, so that they can be transferred
  between 32 and 64 bit versions of Unison.
* Suggests to use the "perms" option (with a suitable value)
  when synchronizing permissions fails (for instance on a FAT
  filesystem under Unix)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.4

* Don't crash when 'merge' is invoked on a new file.


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.3

* Updates to Win32 installation instructions

* Corrections to documentation (thanks to Loic Kerloch)

* Updates to BUGS.txt

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.2

* Fix bug with case insensitive mode on case sensitive file systems
* Uigtk2: hide the "View details" button rather than making it insensitive
  (I find this button a bit confusing as is not clear what it is
   supposed to do)
* When deleting a directory, do not skip any file (neither temporary
  files nor lone appledouble files).  We used to skip temporary files
  corresponding to a different pair of roots, but this makes the
  directory deletion fail.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.1

* Fixed bug regarding fastcheck and daylight saving time under Windows
  when Unison is setup to synchronize modification times.
  (Modification times cannot be updated in the archive in this case,
  thus we have to ignore one hour differences.)
* In Name.fromString, raise a transient error rather than an invalid
  argument error when a filename contains a slash '/' (this can occur
  under Windows when using some multibyte character encodings).
* Fail when a path does not point to anywhere in the filesystem, rather
  that reporting an error for this path.  Indeed, the archives can be left
  in a non-identical state in this case.
* Some clean-up in Files.checkContentsChangeLocal.  In particular, put
  the suggestion to disable fastcheck in a case where it can
  actually be reported to the user.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.0

* Fixed bug with synchronizing resource forks toward a Windows machine
  (open fails with a an error ENOENT rather than ENOTDIR for non
   existing directories under Windows)
* Only protects the two Os.rename with the commit log, in order the
  minimize the likelihood of the DANGER.README file to remain.
  (The backups and the deletion of the moved destination file can be
  safely performed without commit log.)
* GTK2 UI: make sure root names are in Unicode format for displaying them.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.-1

Bump version number, following Jerome's protocol change.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.18

* Improved error messages when a Unison server cannot bind to the given port.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.17

* Removed Fspath.fullLocalPath, which does not work with symbolic
  links.  Pass the local path along instead.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.16

* Hopefully fixed problem with ressource forks on a FAT filesystem on
  Mac OS X: we now check that the getattrlist system call actually
  returned the requested information.

  (Could someone check that this code at least compiles: I don't have
   access to a Mac OS X machine at the moment.)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.15

* Incorporated a patch from Karl M. that clears the main window in the
  GTK2 UI when update detection is restarted.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.14

* Incorporated a patch from Kevin Ballard that turns off the "auto"
  flag when the user says "No" to the "Proceed with updates" question in
  the text UI.  (This makes 'auto' more useful.)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.13

* Fix crash reported by Chris Greene on incorrect root specification.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.26.12

* Tidied documentation in preparation for new release.
