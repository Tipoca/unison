CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.2

Deleted some files that don't need to be in the repository.

Mac GUI:
  Handle the "help" command-line argument properly.
  Handle profiles given on the command line properly.
  When a profile has been selected, the profile dialog is replaced by a
    "connecting" message while the connection is being made.  This
    gives better feedback.
  Size of left and right columns is now large enough so that
    "PropsChanged" is not cut off.
