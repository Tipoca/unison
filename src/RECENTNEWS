CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.40.1

* Windows: fix C includes for compilation with MSVC
* Windows: implement somewhat the O_APPEND flag, so that appending
  lines to a profile (ignored files, for instance) works instead of
  overwriting the beginning of the file (the file pointer is moved to
  the end when the file is opened, rather that each time something is
  written, which is good enough here)

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.40.1

* Added a "fat" preference that makes Unison use the right options
  when one of the replica is on a FAT filesystem.
* Allow "prefer/force=newer" even when not synchronizing modification
  times.  (The reconciler will not be aware of the modification time
  of unchanged files, so the synchronization choices of Unison can be
  different from when "times=true", but the behavior remains sane:
  changed files with the most recent modification time will be
  propagated.)
* Automatic archive conversion to case sensitive mode (useful when
  Unison default is case sensitive and the user switches after the
  fact to case insensitive, for instance by setting the "fat"
  preference).
* Make Unicode the default on all architectures (it was only the
  default when a Mac OS X or Windows machine was involved).
* GTK UI: added "Change Profile" toolbar button.
