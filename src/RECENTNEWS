-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.7

* Fixes to the checkin procedure




-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.4

* Generalized \\verb|diff| preference so that it can be given either as just 
  the command name to be used for calculating diffs or else a whole command
  line, containing the strings CURRENT1 and CURRENT2, which will be replaced
  by the names of the files to be diffed before the command is called.

* Added another small fix (by Jerome) to OSX file type display.

* A few other small tweaks


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.3

* Added a synchronize menu item with keyboard shortcut
* Added a merge menu item, still needs to be debugged
* Updated copyright message

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.1

* Makefile hack to force subvversion to update the Rev keyword in
  src/mkProjectInfo.ml on each checkin.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.1

* Fixed some file name case errors that didn't show up on the Mac.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.0

* Using svn keyword substitution for Rev (revision) in src/mkProjectInfo.ml.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.11.0

* Removed PRCS-specific code; many make targets are simply removed.
  In particular, make populate is gone, so you have to use svn add
  and svn delete to change the files in the repository.

* To check in a new version, you should still do make checkin.  This
  requires you to create a logmsg file containing a message like the one
  that used to go in New-Version-Log in unison.prj.  Make checkin will
  delete this file, to avoid messages being reused.

* Removed tools/grabnews.mll.

* Change in src/terminal.ml to recognize password prompts in some
  newer versions of ssh.


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.10.11

* Small fix to Jerome's recent round of changes for OSX metadata synchronization.  

* Added {\\tt retry} preference.  When it is set to a positive integer (default is 0), the
  text UI will retry synchronizing that many times for any paths where transport fails on
  the first attempt.  

* Substantial reworking of the internal logic of the text UI to make it a bit easier to
  modify.
-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.10.3

* The {\\tt dumbtty} flag in the text UI is automatically set to true if the client is 
  running on a Unix system and the {\\tt EMACS}
  environment variable is set to anything other than the empty string.

* On non-Cygwin Windows systems, the UNISON environment variable is now checked first to determine 
  where to look for Unison's archive and preference files, followed by HOME and 
  USERPROFILE in that order.  On Unix and Cygwin systems, HOME is used.

* Small documentation changes suggested by Alan Schmitt.
-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.10.9

* ARCHIVE FORMAT CHANGED: SYNCHRONIZE BEFORE UPGRADING.
* Better error message when trying to send a command which is too big
* Workaround for transferring large files using rsync
* Use buffered I/O for files (this is the only way to open files in binary
  mode under Cygwin)
* Finder flags now synchronized

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.10.4

* Fallback in copy.ml for filesystem that do no support O_EXCL
* Changed buffer size for local file copy (was highly inefficient with
  synchronous writes)
* Ignore chmod failure when deleting a directory
* Fixed assertion failure when resolving a conflict content change /
  permission changes in favor of the content change

-------------------------------

* Mac gui about box now shows correct version number.
* Mac gui help now brings up online documentation in a browser.
