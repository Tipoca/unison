CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.9

Jerome's fix for the problem of syncing resource forks across a
non-Mac system.

Changed a few error messages to use "resource" instead of
"ressource".  I guess "ressource" is the French spelling?

Don't build the src/INSTALLATION file on Mac.

Max's patch for pty.c under Windows.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.8

Better Mac command-line tool.  This one uses Launch Services to find
the Unison application, and it works over ssh.  It should be more
robust when the user moves, renames, or upgrades the Unison
application.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.7

* Changed the command-line tool into a shell script.

  The previous method relied on NSWorkspace and this does not seem to
  work if the user is not logged in to the Console.  You get an error:

    INIT_Processeses(), could not establish the default connection to
    the WindowServer.Abort trap

  The shell script simply invokes the absolute path.  The disadvantage
  of this approach is that it's not as robust if the user moves or
  renames the application.

* The Merge menu item is dimmed as appropriate.


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.6

Mac GUI changes:

    Added a command-line tool for Mac OS X.  It can be installed from
    the Unison menu.

    Added a CFBundleIdentifier, edu.upenn.cis.Unison, to Info.plist for
    the command-line tool, so it can find the application.

    Had to make sure the application is brought to the foreground in case
    it is invoked from the command-line tool.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.5

Removed some uses of ".unison" from code, since the
actual name of the unison directory can vary according
to OS.

Better cleaning in the doc directory and removed bogus
files from svn.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.4

Mac icon now has proper transparency.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.3

High resolution icon for Mac GUI.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.2

Deleted some files that don't need to be in the repository.

Mac GUI:
  Handle the "help" command-line argument properly.
  Handle profiles given on the command line properly.
  When a profile has been selected, the profile dialog is replaced by a
    "connecting" message while the connection is being made.  This
    gives better feedback.
  Size of left and right columns is now large enough so that
    "PropsChanged" is not cut off.
