CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.19.2

* Fixed bug that would cause filenames CONTAINING (as opposed to BEGINNING WITH) a 
  string matching "backupprefix" to be ignored.


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.19.1

* Fixed a bug where the "directory prefix" part of the backupprefix
  preference was being ignored.  (But, while looking at the code in
  the stasher module and experimenting with its behavior, I'm still
  not very convinced that we're doing backups completely right -- looks
  like too many backup files are getting created.)

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.19.-1

* Added some status messages recording when the xferbycopying hint is
  actually used  

* Added version number to log header

* The confirmation of "big deletes" is now controlled by a flag,
  -confirmbigdeletes.  Default is true, which gives the same behavior as
  previously.
