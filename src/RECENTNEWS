* Fixed a bug where the "directory prefix" part of the backupprefix
  preference was being ignored.  (But, while looking at the code in
  the stasher module and experimenting with its behavior, I'm still
  not very convinced that we're doing backups completely right -- looks
  like too many backup files are getting created.)
