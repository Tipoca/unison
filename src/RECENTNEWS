CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.14

* Fixed a bug with completely empty directories under Windows
  (not even containing "." and "..")
* Attempt to resolve issues with synchronizing modification times
  of read-only files under Windows
* Ignore chmod failures when deleting files
* Bug fixes and cleanups in ssh password prompting.  Now works with
  the GTK2 UI under Linux.  (I hope the Mac OS X is not broken.)
* Ignore trailing dots in filenames in case insensitive mode
* Do not keep DANGER.README file if the first rename fail because it
  is not allowed
* Fixed check for path validity
* Proper quoting of paths, files and extensions ignored using the UI
* Added one missing restoreTerminal call in test UI
* The strings CURRENT1 and CURRENT2 are now correctly substitued when
  they occur in the diff preference
* Include profile name in the GTK2 window name
* Added bindings ',' (same as '<') and '.' (same as '>') in the GTK2 UI

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.13

* Archive now updated again when a file seems to have changed but
  actually did not change.
* Fix diff bug (no difference shown the first time)
* Catch any error when Unix.localtime fails when pretty-printing the
  modification time

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.12

* Changed time display to include seconds (so that people on FAT
  filesystems will not be confused when Unison tries to update a file
  time to an odd number of seconds and the filesystem truncates it to
  an even number!)

* Changed some occurrences of List.foo to Safelist.foo (just for paranoia) 

* Added Prefs.name function (actually needed by Harmony) and changed
  type of Prefs.alias to take a Prefs.t instead of a string as first
  parameter (for more safety)

* WARNING: everything compiles, but the new Prefs module has not been
  tested yet.  (I'll do that soon.)

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.10

Tiny fixes.

Tiny fixes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.9

Jerome's fix for the problem of syncing resource forks across a
non-Mac system.

Changed a few error messages to use "resource" instead of
"ressource".  I guess "ressource" is the French spelling?

Don't build the src/INSTALLATION file on Mac.

Max's patch for pty.c under Windows.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.8

Better Mac command-line tool.  This one uses Launch Services to find
the Unison application, and it works over ssh.  It should be more
robust when the user moves, renames, or upgrades the Unison
application.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.7

* Changed the command-line tool into a shell script.

  The previous method relied on NSWorkspace and this does not seem to
  work if the user is not logged in to the Console.  You get an error:

    INIT_Processeses(), could not establish the default connection to
    the WindowServer.Abort trap

  The shell script simply invokes the absolute path.  The disadvantage
  of this approach is that it's not as robust if the user moves or
  renames the application.

* The Merge menu item is dimmed as appropriate.


-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.6

Mac GUI changes:

    Added a command-line tool for Mac OS X.  It can be installed from
    the Unison menu.

    Added a CFBundleIdentifier, edu.upenn.cis.Unison, to Info.plist for
    the command-line tool, so it can find the application.

    Had to make sure the application is brought to the foreground in case
    it is invoked from the command-line tool.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.5

Removed some uses of ".unison" from code, since the
actual name of the unison directory can vary according
to OS.

Better cleaning in the doc directory and removed bogus
files from svn.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.4

Mac icon now has proper transparency.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.3

High resolution icon for Mac GUI.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.12.2

Deleted some files that don't need to be in the repository.

Mac GUI:
  Handle the "help" command-line argument properly.
  Handle profiles given on the command line properly.
  When a profile has been selected, the profile dialog is replaced by a
    "connecting" message while the connection is being made.  This
    gives better feedback.
  Size of left and right columns is now large enough so that
    "PropsChanged" is not cut off.

-------------------------------
