(* This module maintains a cache that can be used to map
   an Os.fingerprint to a (Fspath.t * Path.t) naming a file that *may*
   (if we are lucky) have this fingerprint.  The cache is not guaranteed
   to be reliable -- the things it returns are only hints, and must be
   double-checked before they are used (to optimize file transfers). *)
