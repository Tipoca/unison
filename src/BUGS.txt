                         OUTSTANDING UNISON BUGS
                         =======================

SHOWSTOPPERS
============

Mac OSX, Windows XP: 
  - Unison does not understand extended attributes (OSX) or alternate data
    streams (XP) and will not synchronize them properly. 

Linux, Solaris: 
  - None known.

  By the way, there is a bug if you are doing a merge and
  are propagating times, the times of the merged file end
  up different so you have to sync again.  I guess this
  might be a feature, I don't know which way to propagate
  the times...

[May 2006, Schmitt]
  In presence of path that cannot be propagated, Unison may have a fatal
    error "archives not identical". 
  Here is the setting:
    replica A:
      tmp/ubug/foo
      tmp/toto/foo
    replica B:
      tmp/
  profile:
    root = /Users/schmitta/tmp
    root = ssh://beauty/tmp
    # common options
    sshargs = -C
    servercmd = bin/unison
    path = ubug/foo
    path = toto
  The run: (* message that there are no archive *)
    local          beauty.local
             error            ubug/foo
    path ubug/foo is not valid because ubug is not a directory in one of the replicas
    dir      ---->            toto  [f]

[July 2002, Findler]
  I get this message from unison:
    Fatal error: Internal error: New archives are not identical.
    Retaining original archives.  Please run Unison again to bring them
     up to date. 
    If you get this message again, please notify unison-help@cis.upenn.edu.
  and I think that I know what's going wrong. Unison is somehow using a
  key consisting of the result of `hostname' (and maybe other stuff) to
  uniquely identify an archive. I have two macos x machine and I use both
  of them to sync to a third (solaris) place. The problem seems to be
  that unison can't tell the difference between two macos x machines,
  since the default setup under macos x always gives the hostname
  "localhost".
  --
  So, I wonder if there is some other way to distinguish the two
  hostnames. Things that come to mind: ip addresses (but that can be bad
  if the machine moves around), ethernet addresses (but my laptop has two
  of them -- still better than ip addresses, I think) or perhaps some
  macos-specific mechanism for getting the macos name of the computer.
  --
  For now, I've just changed the result of `hostname' on one of my
  machines, but I just made up something that no DNS server agrees with,
  so that might cause me trouble down the line, I'd bet.
  ===> We should use some more information to make sure the archive names are
       unique enough.  But what, exactly?

[Aug 2002] OSX native filesystems are case insensitive, like Windows, but
Unison does not currently recognize this.  A workaround is to set the
'ignorecase' preference explicitly to true.

[July 2002] Unison does not understand Windows' non-Latin character set
  encodings.  For some other character sets (e.g. European characters
  such as u-umlaut), only the display is affected.  For character sets
  that use multi-byte encoding schemes (e.g. Japanese), Unison can
  actually get confused and synchronize incorrectly.  (One case where
  this can happen is if the second byte of a two-byte character is
  actually a slash!)
     ==> This would be hard to fix, given OCaml's current poor support
         for localization.  Jacques Garrigue made some suggestions (bcp
         has them in a mail message) that might be the basis for looking
         at this if someone is really motivated, but they look like real
         work. 
     ==> The right think to do is to use the Windows Unicode API

[APril 2002, Jason Eisner] Recently I found an aliasing problem that may
  endanger Unison's semantics.  
  --
  The problem is with the "follow" directive, which is documented like
  this: "Including the preference -follow <pathspec> causes Unison to
  treat symbolic links matching <pathspec> as 'invisible' and behave as
  if the thing pointed to by the link had appeared literally at this
  place in the replica."
  --
  If one of these invisible (elsewhere called "transparent") symlinks
  points outside the replica, all is well and good.  But if it points to
  something in the replica, then Unison now has two names for the same
  file.  It doesn't currently detect the aliasing.  As a result, it keeps
  separate information for the two names in the archive files.
  [A long example is in a mailmessage in BCP's files]

[April 2002] File times are reported incorrectly under Win32 after a
  switch to/from daylight saving time.  Here is a link, to shed some
  light on why this might be happening:
  http://www.codeproject.com/datetime/dstbugs.asp
  FIXED (a difference of exactly one hour is ignored)

starting Unison on two non-existent local directories leads to an
  assertion failure in path.ml

  The server crashes everytime the client is finished.
      "Fatal Error: Error in waiting on port: "
          "The network name is not available anymore" (rough translation from
  German)
  I use Unison on two XP Professional machines, German versions, with the
  simple tcp connection.

Andy Starrer  [Aug 2002]
  After connecting to server and trying to do first original sync
   with empty client dir, the server searches a while and then shows a dialog:
  --
   Uncaught exception File "/usr/ports/net/unison/work/unison-2.9.1/path.ml,
    line 0, characters 1785-1797: Assertion failed
  -- 
  using an awk line & char numbering print,
   these char #s in path.ml fall on the "assert false" on line 69
  (first line of file shows char count of 0)
  -- 
  66 1707 let parent path =
  67 1725   match rtl path with
  68 1747     RTL(_::p) -> RTL(p)
  69 1771   | RTL [] -> assert false
  70 1798   | LTR _ -> assert false
  --
  ===> Who is calling parent on an empty path???
  
Another report of the same (?) bug by Ruslan Ermolov:
  Attempting to symlink ~/.unison/backup to
  another (real) directory results in the following uncaught exception:
  --
  : $ ls -ld ~/.unison/*backup
  : lrwx------  1 ru  sunbay   10 Aug  6 15:22 /home/ru/.unison/backup -> realbackup

  OTOH, Unison follows ~/.unison if it's symlinked, and I use this feature
  when using SSH as a transport.

  Stack overflow on huge directory...
  ---
  It turns out a dir I had was messing unison all up.  It was
  not huge, only 137 MB.  But it is was up of mostly empty files:
  396326 of them.  So theres your bug report.  I don't need these files,
  but I wish that the error message was clearer.
  ---
  here is gdb's backtraces, but there is no debug symbols:
  #0  0x080acd30 in re_compile_pattern ()
  #1  0x080ace22 in re_compile_pattern ()
  #2  0x080a871c in re_compile_pattern ()
  #3  0x080717f7 in strcpy ()
  Cannot access memory at address 0x26
  ---
  ===> The stack trace seems bogus.  This problem might be fixed now, 
       but, I guess we still need to fix Os.childrenOf, which does not
       seem tail-recursive.
       DONE

Jamey Leifer [July 2002]
 * [graphic ui, bug] If one of the files "has unknown type" (i.e. is a
   system file), then pressing "f" (i.e. "Retry on unsynchronised items")
   results in an error window and unison quiting.  To me "Retry" implies
   less drastic behaviour.  It should just report errors as normal.

BCP  [May 2002]
  The "rescan paths that failed previous sync" function misses some files.
  E.g., if a directory has failed to transfer because the disk ran out of
  space and I hit 'f', it will come back with "Everything is up to date",
  even though doing a full re-sync will again recognize the directory as
  needing to be transferred.

Jason Eisner [April, 2002]
  The Merge feature does not appear to modify file times.  Thus, when
  times=true, using the Merge feature on
     changed ? changed    myfile
  turns it into
     props   ? props      myfile
  and to finish the sync, I have to decide which file time "wins."
  This differs from the behavior that I would expect and find more
  convenient: namely, if I perform the merge at 3pm, then it counts as a
  change to BOTH replicas of myfile and they should both end up with a
  time of 3pm.
  So I'd suggest that myfile in the local replica should have its
  modtime as well as its contents changed to that of
  #unisonmerged-myfile (the temporary file produced by the Merge
  program).  Then this modtime and contents should be propagated to the
  remote myfile as usual, handling clock skew as for any other propagation.
  Other file properties should probably NOT be propagated.

Unison should report a better error message when a modified file slips
  through the fast check and is later detected during transport.

I got this
  C:\CygWin\home\kmoerder>unison a ssh://moerder/a
  kmoerder@moerder's password:
  C:\CygWin\home\kmoerder>Fatal error: Error in grabbing:
  Broken pipe [read()]

This should be caught and reported cleanly:
  ~/.unison> unison ~/.unison/mail
  Uncaught exception Invalid_argument("Os.string2name('/home/bcpierce/.unison/mail.prf' contains a '/')")

dworley:
  Unison sometimes aborts if one of the files it is synchronizing
  changes during the run.  Most of the time, it can step over the
  file correctly, but sometimes it bails out.  This can be a problem
  in an environment where you cannot guarantee that the two
  filesystems are stable during the Unison run.
  ==> More information needed

Karl Moerder:
  The statusdepth doesn't seem to change anything (like it is being
  ignored). I set it to 2 ("statusdepth = 2" in my .prf file) and got the
  same display as the default (setting of 1). I didn't check if the
  default really acted like 1, so it could be that I need to set it to a
  higher value. I can play with it more later if you need me to.

Karl Moerder:
  The synchronization of modification times does not work on directories
  (WinNT folders) or on read-only files. I found this when I tried to
  synchronize mod times on an otherwise synchronized tree. It failed
  gracefully on these. The "[click..." message is a nice touch.
  ==> [Nothing we can do for read-only files; need to patch ocaml for
       directories...]
 
Bob H. reported an abnormal failure during transport that apparently led to
  an immediate, dirty termination instead of a clean failure, trapped and
  properly displayed in the user interface:
   - on Windows (of course)
   - Unison was trying to propagate a file onto a file that was open
     in another application; in Windows, this causes an error
   - the error was apparently not caught in the usual way, but instead
     terminated Unison, leaving a DANGER.README file

"After I synchronized two directories I created a new profile, which
  defaulted to the same directories.  I synchronized again (no changes,
  which was fine) but the Unison program did not save the directory names
  in the new profile.  Later attemts to use that new profile failed, of
  course, and further random clicking resulted in a message asking me to
  delete non-existent lock files.  I responded by exiting the program,
  manually deleting the .prf file, and starting over.  This is a minor
  bug, I suppose, the root cause of which is the failure to save the
  directory names in a new profile when they were copied unchanged from a
  previous profile and/or no files had changed in these directories --
  the type of bug that can only affect a new user, and so easy to
  overlook in testing."

The "Diff" window [under Windows] sometimes shows nothing.  Does this
  arise from a missing "Diff" program?  We should detect this case!

"Hanrahan, Donald" <dhanrahan@logicon.com>
  Finally, I discovered that a preceeding "/" in a "defaultpath" entry
  (e.g., defaultpath=/myshare/myfolder
  vs. defaultpath=myshare/myfolder) seems to cause an unhandled
  exception (Invalid_argument <"os.string2path">) to occur.

** The "total size transferred" in the GTK UI should be stored in an
   Int64; otherwise large transfers will overflow it.
   ==> change Util.filesize to int64 (this seems like a "right thing",
       but seems to cause an "out of memory" error on the first sync of
       my full replica).  Should try this again.   -BCP
   ==> even if we can't do this change, we should at least recognize when
       filesizes are too big to represent and generate a sensible error
       message! 
   ==> But, at the moment, we're blocked by an OCaml bug

COSMETIC 
========

Interactively adding an ignore pattern for src will not make
  src/RECENTNEWS immediately disappear (as it does not directly match
  the pattern)...

[Mar 2002] When transferring by copying, copies on the remote side are
  not taken into account by the progress meter.

progress bar calculation is not quite right -- e.g. dir sizes are not
  always accurate?
  [One needs to consider simultaneously the archive and the update to
   compute the size a directory (consider a directory with some
   updates deep inside]
  [also, Diff has an effect on the progress bar!]
