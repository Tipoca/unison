<P><B>Philadelphia, PA (September 27, 2000)</B> -- The Unison development
team at the University of Pennsylvania has announced a new public release
(version 2.5) of its file synchronization tool for Unix and Windows
systems.  The new version incorporates (among many other improvements) an
implementation of the "rsync protocol" for diffs-only propagation of
small changes to large files.
<BR>

<P>
The current release is available for immediate download from

 <A HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison</A>

in both source and binary form.<BR>

<P>

Unison allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be
stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
each replica to the other.  The protocol for file transfers now
incorporates a key algorithm from Andrew Tridgell's popular <A
HREF="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</A> utility, allowing small changes
in large files to be reconciled by transmitting only a few bytes over the
network.  

<p>

Unison 
shares a number of features with tools such as configuration
management packages (<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">CVS</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU/~jmacd/prcs.html">PRCS</A>,
etc.) 
distributed filesystems 
(<A HREF="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">Coda</A>, 
etc.)
uni-directional mirroring utilities 
(<A HREF="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</A>, 
etc.)
and other synchronizers 
(<A HREF="http://www.pumatech.com">Intellisync</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.merl.com/reports/TR99-14/">Reconcile</A>,
etc), but differs in 
 several significant areas:
<UL>
<LI>
Unison runs on both Windows (95, 98, NT, and 2k) and Unix (Solaris,
 Linux, etc.) systems. Moreover, Unison works <EM>across</EM>
 platforms, allowing a Windows laptop, for example, to synchronize with a
 Unix fileserver.

<LI>Unlike a full-blown distributed filesystem, Unison is a user-level
 program: it can be run without kernel modifications or superuser
 permissions on either host.

<LI>Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal
 with updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure.
 Updates that do not conflict are propagated automatically.
 Conflicting updates are detected and displayed.

<LI>Unison works between any pair of machines connected to the
 internet, communicating over either a direct socket link or
 tunneling over an <TT>rsh</TT> or an encrypted <TT>ssh</TT> connection.
 It is careful with network bandwidth, and runs well over slow links
 such as PPP connections.

<LI>Unison has a clear and precise specification and comes with
extensive documentation. 

<LI>Unison is resilient to failure. It is careful to leave the
 replicas and its own private structures in a sensible state at all
 times, even in case of abnormal termination or communication
 failures.

<LI>Unison is free; complete source code is available under the GNU
Public License.
