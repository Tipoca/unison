Checklist: 

  - Move everything interesting from src/RECENTNEWS to doc/changes.tex  

  - If this is a significant release (not just a minor bugfix release), 
    increment the major version number by editing src/mkProjectInfo.ml

  - Do a 'make checkin' if anything has changed (including in the steps
    just above) -- we need to make sure that the exact release version
    is reflected in the repository, in case we need to check it out again
    later to redo or fix the build.

  - If this is a stable release, make sure you remembered to do a 
    'make exportstable', not just 'make export'.
