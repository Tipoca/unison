Checklist: 
  - Move everything interesting from src/RECENTNEWS to doc/changes.tex  

  - Do a 'make checkin' if anything has changed (including in the step
    just above) -- we need to make sure that the exact release version
    is reflected in the repository, in case we need to check it out again
    later to redo or fix the build.

  - If this is a significant release (not just a minor bugfix release), 
    increment the major version number
       prcs checkin -rN       (where N is the next number, e.g. 8 if we
                               are moving from 2.7.34 to 2.8.1)
       prcs checkout 

  - If this is a stable release, make sure you remembered to do a 
    'make exportstable', not just 'make export'.
